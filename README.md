# Basic Data Analysis And LMS
Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. Python program that reads the data set into memory and computes the mean, minimum and maximum of the petal width, petal length, sepal width and sepal length attributes for each of the three species of flower. Scatter plot that shows the petal length attribute on the x-axis, and the sepal length attribute on the y-axis.  With a subset of the Iris data that contains only the sepal length attribute, and only the setosa and virginica classes a scatterplot is drawn showing the attribute on the x-axis and the class on the y-axis. Using the LMS algorithm the weight vector (w0, w1) is computed and add the line of best the plot.
